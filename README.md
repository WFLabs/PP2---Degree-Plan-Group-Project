# PP2---Degree-Plan-Group-Project

This is our group Degree Plan Project

Currently it has a handful of Majors, all derived from a Major class, which itself is derived from a Student class.
This way, a student object can be made and later redefined as the student selects his major and classes.

We still need to figure out how to get the vector to play friendly with it.
We also need to flush out each of the classes w/ more info.
We also need to figure out a way to display the info as a schedule w/ a schedule function.

Then it's simply a matter of passing that vector to each of our functions.
